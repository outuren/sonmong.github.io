				Attending Miami University offers me a lot of chance to approach and learn to use new digital tools such as Adobe Illustrator,       Adobe Photoshop, or Adobe InDesign, etc. Right now, I am currently learning how to use Adobe AfterEffects. Moreover, to improve what I could do, studying the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is important, and this website is developed using those three languages.
